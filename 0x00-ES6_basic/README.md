# ES6 Basics
In this project, we were required to familarize with the use of the EcmaScript 6 standard. The programs were written and tested on  Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `NodeJS` 12.11.1 and `npm` v6.11.3 

To run the program:
1. Ensure you have git installed on your local machine and clone the repository with the command
    - `git clone https://github.com/tpauldike/alx-backend-javascript.git`

2. Navigate into the directory `cd alx-backend-javascript/0x00-ES6_basic`
3. Install `node.js`, if you do not have it installed yet, `sudo apt update -y ; sudo apt install nodejs -y`
4. Install the node package manager `sudo apt install npm`
5. Install all the packages and dependencies `npm install`
6. Get some test files, import the modules written here and test them by running the script `npm run dev <test_file>`
